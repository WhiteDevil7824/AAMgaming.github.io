                    Team Sonic Racing's existence came to light when a Sumo Digital memo
                    <br><br>
                    leaked in January 2018, with Sega confirming it the following May. Its
                    <br><br>
                    marketing campaign included appearances at trade shows, a one-shot
                    <br><br>
                    comic from IDW Publishing, and a two-part animated series. The game
                    <br><br>
                    was released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox
                    <br><br>
                    One in May 2019. A simplified version for iOS developed by Hardlight,
                    <br><br>
                    Sonic Racing, was released via Apple Arcade in September 2019. The
                    <br><br>
                    game was later released on Amazon Luna in March 2021. Unlike its
                    <br><br>
                    predecessors, it received mixed reviews from critics; while its team-based
                    <br><br>
                    gameplay, track designs, and music were praised, both the story mode
                    <br><br>
                    and voice acting were criticized.

                    <br><br><br><br>
                    Team Sonic Racing is a Sonic the Hedgehog-themed kart racing game
                    <br><br>
                    featuring single-player and multiplayer modes. After selecting one of
                    <br><br>
                    15 characters from the series' cast,[a] players participate in races using
                    <br><br>
                    sports cars on courses thematically based on locations from the franchise.
                    <br><br>
                    There are three types of racing classes: speed, technique, and power.
                    <br><br>
                    Each type has its own unique abilities; for example, technique racers like
                    <br><br>
                    Tails can drive over rough surfaces like grass without slowing down. The
                    <br><br>
                    player views gameplay from a third-person perspective and runs over
                    <br><br>
                    panels to get speed boosts, performs tricks in midair, and drifts to make
                    <br><br>
                    sharp turns. Power-ups called Wisps can be collected from canisters with
                    <br><br>
                    "?" marks and grant players temporary offensive and defensive advantages.
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    There are 21 tracks in total. Players can customize their vehicles, with new
                    <br><br>
                    parts unlocked as they progress through the game. Customization options
                    <br><br>
                    can be purchased using in-game currency called Mod Pods, which are
                    <br><br>
                    earned by competing in races. Parts modify cars' handling, boost,
                    <br><br>
                    acceleration, defense, and top speed, and players can also make aesthetic
                    <br><br>
                    changes such as paint jobs and horn sounds. The game supports four-
                    <br><br>
                    player local multiplayer, up to twelve online, and up to three in Team
                    <br><br>
                    Adventure.
