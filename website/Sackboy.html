                        sackboy: A Big Adventure is a platform game. Unlike previous
                        <br><br>
                        LittleBigPlanet entries with 2.5D platforming, it features a range of
                        <br><br>
                        perspectives and 3D movement. Players control Sackboy on world
                        <br><br>
                        maps which give access to a multitude of platforming levels and bonus
                        <br><br>
                        content. As Sackboy completes each stage new ones unlock allowing
                        <br><br>
                        him to progress further. All levels contain collectable objects called
                        <br><br>
                        Dreamer Orbs which must be collected en-masse to progress to the
                        <br><br>
                        end of the game.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        Sackboy’s move set is greatly expanded from previous entries and players
                        <br><br>
                        can now slap at will, roll around, nosedive, pick-up objects and flutter
                        <br><br>
                        jump, to name a few. Moves can be chained together to create combos that
                        <br><br>
                        allow skilled players to travel greater distances. Each level in the game
                        <br><br>
                        employs a series of interactable objects that require at least one of Sackboy’s
                        <br><br>
                        moves to progress. Sackboy also has access to multiple stages where he can
                        <br><br>
                        use new powerups. The Grappling Hook, now called the Clawstring, returns
                        <br><br>
                        from LittleBigPlanet 2, allowing Sackboy to grab onto object from afar, the
                        <br><br>
                        Whirltool is a boomerang-like device that can be thrown to defeat enemies
                        <br><br>
                        and break objects and finally the Plasma Pumps allow Sackboy to hover in
                        <br><br>
                        the air and fire energy blasts.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        The game is fully playable in both local and online multiplayer allowing up to
                        <br><br>
                        4 players to experience the game together. There are stages in each world that
                        <br><br>
                        require multiple players to enter and are specifically designed so players must
                        <br><br>
                        work together to progress. The game originally did not ship with online
                        <br><br>
                        functionality. The feature was added in a patch a month later on 17 December
                        <br><br>
                        2020.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        The game does not feature any Create Mode akin to LittleBigPlanet entries,
                        <br><br>
                        only making certain nods to it through collectables. Players can still customize
                        <br><br>
                        their Sackboy via ZomZom’s Shop. ZomZom is a travelling haberdasher that
                        <br><br>
                        returns after his appearance in LittleBigPlanet 3. In his shop players can buy
                        <br><br>
                        new costumes, try on collected outfits and even paint costume pieces.
                        <br><br>
                        Costumes created by the player can be saved and are then available to choose
                        <br><br>
                        when a level is entered.
