                <br><br>
                a single "long" primary weapon (a gun or long melee weapon) and and two backup "short"
                <br><br>
                secondary weapons (pistols, SMGs, short melee weapons). They have access to different types
                <br><br>
                of headgear like helmets or gasmasks, body armor and tools. Different body armors unlock
                <br><br>
                different number of pockets (inventory slots that can be accessed with hotkeys). Player also
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                damage to everything in the explosion radius. The inventory size player can carry is
                <br><br>
                restricted by the sizeof their backpack (which can be increased with special items) and
                <br><br>
                maximum carry weight. Too much stuff in a backpack will increase the stamina usage or
