                        secrets to find. Getting started and knowing what to spend your time on
                        <br><br>
                        can be a daunting task, especially since the in-game tool-tips are not

                        always entirely helpful or may be translated awkwardly.

                        Once you have selected your captain, it is advisable to follow the prompts for
                        <br><br>
                        the first set of missions. Many game mechanics are unavailable until you
                        <br><br>
                        finish some of the tutorial steps. Other aspects of the game are unavailable

                        early on until you meet certain requirements which we will cover below. Once

                        your ship, the game is pretty much open to you. It may be possible to build up a

                        fleet of 5 warships and millions of gold before you even finish the first chapter

                        <br><br>
                        to some other crew members who will join your fleet. Some crew members will
                        <br><br>
                        join right away, you just have to find them. Others will have more complex missions
                        <br><br>
                        or requirements that need to be met. There are other guides on Steam that go into
