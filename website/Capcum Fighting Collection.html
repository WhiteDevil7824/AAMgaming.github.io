                        Capcom Fighting Collection is a compilation of arcade versions of ten
                        <br><br>
                        fighting games originally developed and published by Capcom. Most
                        <br><br>
                        prominently, all five arcade entries in the Darkstalkers franchise are
                        <br><br>
                        included, marking the first time the full series will be made available
                        <br><br>
                        outside Japan. The collection also includes Red Earth for its first ever
                        <br><br>
                        release outside arcades. The compilation features online play with

                        rollback netcode, training and spectator modes, save states, concept
                        <br><br>
                        art, design documents, and a music player. Similar to Darkstalkers
                        <br><br>
                        Resurrection, the compilation will not have the extra/boss playable
                        <br><br>
                        characters featured from the home console versions, unlike the

                        The game was released on June 24, 2022 on Nintendo Switch,
                        <br><br>
                        PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. A special physical edition
                        <br><br>
                        will include Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection exclusively

                        in Japan. Pre-orders and early purchases of the collection include
                        <br><br>
                        digital codes of all new music remixes, original & exclusive
                        <br><br>
                        illustrations, and Three Wonders for Capcom Arcade 2nd Stadium.
                        <br><br>
                        The re-releases of Vampire Hunter 2 and Vampire Savior 2, however,
                        <br><br>
                        removed the secret ending, whose background artwork implied an
                        <br><br>
                        incestuous relationship between Morrigan and Lilith Aensland,
                        <br><br>
                        who are canonically sisters.

                        On September 27, 2022, a free update was released for all versions.
                        <br><br>
                        This update includes adding quality of life features, making existing
                        <br><br>
                        features more robust, bug fixes both for the collection as a whole and
                        <br><br>
                        the original games, and some console exclusive changes like ID tags
                        <br><br>
                        on PlayStation 4 and a bug involving the online leaderboard on
                        <br><br>
                        Nintendo Switch.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        GameSpot and Hardcore Gamer praised the approachability of the
                        <br><br>
                        added mechanics, "perfect" port quality of the compilation, and Red
                        <br><br>
                        Earth's inclusion, but felt the compilation lacked variety with the
                        <br><br>
                        overrepresentation of the Darkstalkers franchise, and lamented the
                        <br><br>
                        exclusion of more forgotten Capcom fighting games. IGN gave heavy
                        <br><br>
                        praise to the modern rollback netcode and the inclusion of "an
                        <br><br>
                        impressive museum filled with interesting art and music, and a snappy
                        <br><br>
                        UI linking everything together", but took minor issue with the absence
                        <br><br>
                        of cross-platform play and the exclusion of Street Fighter III. Nintendo
                        <br><br>
                        Life lauded the compilation's "excellent, polished, and accurate"
                        <br><br>
                        presentation, inclusion of the Darkstalkers franchise and Red Earth,
                        <br><br>
                        and the "excellent" online net-code. The site also criticized the exclusion
                        <br><br>
                        of inaccessible titles and the lack of both in-game soft resets and
                        <br><br>
                        untranslated text in the Vampire Savior games. Push Square was similarly
                        <br><br>
                        impressed by the game, giving it 9 stars out of 10, but thought the gallery
                        <br><br>
                        content lacked contextualization and that Cyberbots was a poor inclusion.
                        <br><br>
                        Shacknews liked the additions made to the game, including online play, a
                        <br><br>
                        lobby system, training modes, and save states, but noted the exclusion of
                        <br><br>
                        quality of life features from certain games, lack of crossplay, and that some
                        <br><br>
                        games were "arcade-hard" by default. TouchArcade felt that the Switch
                        <br><br>
                        version of the compilation included "a pretty good collection of games"
                        <br><br>
                        but noted that "The overlap with other collections and my bad experiences
                        <br><br>
                        with the online play keep me from recommending this too enthusiastically...
                        <br><br>
                        this is still worth picking up for fans of Capcom's fighters."
