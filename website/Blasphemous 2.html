                    Blasphemous 2 is a 2D side-scrolling Metroidvania action-adventure game.
                    <br><br>
                    Players assume control of the Penitent One, a silent knight who must embark
                    <br><br>
                    on a new adventure in a new kingdom to prevent the rebirth of a curse named
                    <br><br>
                    "The Miracle". The story of the game is set after the "Wounds Of Eventide"
                    <br><br>
                    update of the original game. As with previous games in the series, the world
                    <br><br>
                    in the game is filled with deadly traps, difficult platform sequences, hostile
                    <br><br>
                    enemies and boss characters,though players will also encounter other non-
                    <br><br>
                    playable characters will either offer aid to the player or send them on side
                    <br><br>
                    quests.
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    The game introduces several new weapons, with each having their own reach,
                    <br><br>
                    speed, special abilities and skill tree. The weapons in the game include the
                    <br><br>
                    War Censer, which deals powerful but slow attacks, Rapier and Dagger, a dual-
                    <br><br>
                    wielding weapon which deals rapid damages, and the Praying Blade, a versatile
                    <br><br>
                    weapon that blends the strength of both weapons. These weapons are also
                    <br><br>
                    useful for traversal, aiding players in discovering new paths and solving puzzles.
                    <br><br>
                    The abilities of the protagonist can also be customized. Players can equip up to
                    <br><br>
                    five "rosary beads", which provide passive bonuses to the player, and two
                    <br><br>
                    active spells (known as prayers) in the game. Players can also collect statues
                    <br><br>
                    which provide small bonuses by themselves, and more significant buffs when
                    <br><br>
                    they are placed together in certain combinations.
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    After resurrecting and obtaining a new weapon to replace the Mea Culpa,
                    <br><br>
                    the Penitent One encounters an angelic woman named Anunciada, who
                    <br><br>
                    instructs him to destroy the Miracle's new child and prevent the Miracle
                    <br><br>
                    from returning. In order to do this, the Penitent Once must collect the
                    <br><br>
                    Three Regrets, which will open a path for the Penitent One to reach the
                    <br><br>
                    heart in the sky. With a new mission, the Penitent One proceeds to travel
                    <br><br>
                    across Cvstodia again, collecting to the Three Regrets as well as
                    <br><br>
                    eliminating all of the members of the Archconfraternity.
