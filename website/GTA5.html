                        Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar
                        <br><br>
                        North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the seventh main entry in the

                        <br><br>
                        fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas,
                        <br><br>
                        based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three
                        <br><br>
                        protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster
                        <br><br>
                        Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—and
                        <br><br>
                        their attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt
                        <br><br>
                        government agency and powerful criminals. The open world design lets
                        <br><br>
                        players freely roam San Andreas's open countryside and the fictional

                        and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many

                        missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A "wanted" system governs

                        Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game played from either a third-
                        <br><br>
                        person[3] or first-person perspective. Players complete missions—linear scenarios
                        <br><br>
                        with set objectives—to progress through the story. Outside of the missions, players
                        <br><br>
                        may freely roam the open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside
                        <br><br>
                        area, including the fictional Blaine County, and the fictional city of Los Santos, the
                        <br><br>
                        world is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series. It may be fully
                        <br><br>
                        explored after the game's beginning without restriction, although story progress
                        <br><br>
                        unlocks more gameplay content.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa,
                        <br><br>
                        Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton—criminals whose stories interconnect as
                        <br><br>
                        they complete missions. Some missions are completed with only one character
                        <br><br>
                        and others feature two or three. Outside the missions, players may switch
                        <br><br>
                        between characters at will by a directional compass on the HUD, although this
                        <br><br>
                        feature becomes restricted at various points throughout the story. The game
                        <br><br>
                        may switch characters automatically during missions to complete specific
                        <br><br>
                        objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if he is in danger and
                        <br><br>
                        needs help, and flash white if he has a strategic advantage. Though players
                        <br><br>
                        complete missions as any of the three protagonists, the more difficult heist
                        <br><br>
                        missions require aid from AI-controlled accomplices with unique skill sets
                        <br><br>
                        like computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice survives a successful heist,
                        <br><br>
                        they take a cut from the cash reward and may be available for later missions
                        <br><br>
                        with improvements to their unique skills. Some heists afford multiple strategies;
                        <br><br>
                        in a holdup mission, players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an
                        <br><br>
                        incapacitating agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        Each character has a set of eight skills that represent their ability in specific areas
                        <br><br>
                        such as shooting and driving. Though skills improve through play, each character
                        <br><br>
                        has a skill with expertise by default (e.g. Trevor's flying skill). The eighth "special"
                        <br><br>
                        skill determines the effectiveness in performing an ability that is unique to each
                        <br><br>
                        respective character. Michael enters bullet time in combat, Franklin slows down
                        <br><br>
                        time while driving, and Trevor deals twice as much damage to enemies while
                        <br><br>
                        taking half as much in combat. A meter on each character's HUD depletes
                        <br><br>
                        when an ability is being used and regenerates when players perform skilful
                        <br><br>
                        actions (for example, drifting in vehicles as Franklin or performing headshots
                        <br><br>
                        as Michael).
