                        Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is an action-adventure game played from a third-
                        <br><br>
                        person view. Compared to FromSoftware's Dark Souls series, the game
                        <br><br>
                        features fewer role-playing elements, lacks character creation and the ability
                        <br><br>
                        to level up a variety of stats, and has no multiplayer elements. It does,

                        however, include gear upgrading, a skill tree, and limited ability customization.
                        <br><br>
                        Rather than attacking to whittle an enemy's health points, combat in Sekiro
                        <br><br>
                        revolves around using a katana to attack their posture and balance instead,
                        <br><br>
                        as well as deflecting incoming enemy attacks, eventually leading to an
                        <br><br>
                        opening that allows for a single killing blow.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        The game also features stealth elements, allowing players to instantly eliminate
                        <br><br>
                        some enemies if they can get in range undetected. In addition, the player
                        <br><br>
                        character can use various tools to assist with combat and exploration, such as a
                        <br><br>
                        grappling hook. If the player character dies, they can be revived on the spot if
                        <br><br>
                        they have resurrection power, which is restored by defeating enemies, instead
                        <br><br>
                        of respawning at earlier checkpoints.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        After collecting all the components for the ritual, Sekiro is confronted by Owl,
                        <br><br>
                        who is revealed to be the assailant who backstabbed Sekiro at the Hirata estate.
                        <br><br>
                        Owl reveals he also seeks the Dragon Heritage and orders Sekiro to renounce
                        <br><br>
                        his loyalty to Kuro. If Sekiro does so, he is corrupted by bloodlust and becomes
                        <br><br>
                        a Shura, murdering Emma, Isshin, and Owl as Kuro watches in horror,
                        <br><br>
                        resulting in the "bad" ending. If Sekiro sides with Kuro, Owl attacks and forces
                        <br><br>
                        Sekiro to kill him. Sekiro then retrieves the Mortal Blade and enters the Divine
                        <br><br>
                        Realm to collect the final material for the ritual. Upon returning to Ashina,
                        <br><br>
                        Sekiro discovers Isshin has succumbed to his illness and that the castle is under
                        <br><br>
                        attack by the Interior Ministry. Sekiro eventually finds Kuro under attack by
                        <br><br>
                        Genichiro, whom he defeats again. Realizing Ashina is lost, Genichiro sacrifices
                        <br><br>
                        himself in a ritual to revive Isshin in his prime so that he might restore Ashina.
                        <br><br>
                        Isshin honors his grandson's wish and fights Sekiro.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        After defeating Isshin, there are three possible endings. Performing the Immortal
                        <br><br>
                        Severance ritual results in the eponymous standard ending, where the Dragon
                        <br><br>
                        Heritage is removed at the cost of Kuro's life. Afterward, like the Sculptor before
                        <br><br>
                        him, Sekiro retires as a shinobi and spends the remainder of his days carving
                        <br><br>
                        Buddha statues. Working with Emma to find an alternative way of severing
                        <br><br>
                        immortality results in the Purification ending, where Sekiro sacrifices himself
                        <br><br>
                        instead of Kuro. The final ending, Dragon's Homecoming, is obtained by helping
                        <br><br>
                        a character known as the Divine Child of the Rejuvenating Waters. Kuro's body
                        <br><br>
                        dies, but his spirit lives on inside the Divine Child, who goes on a journey with
                        <br><br>
                        Sekiro to return the Dragon Heritage to its original place.
