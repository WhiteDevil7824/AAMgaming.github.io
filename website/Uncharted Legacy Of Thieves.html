                        <u>Gameplay</u>
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        In combat, players can use long-ranged weapons, such as rifles and shotguns, and
                        <br><br>
                        short-barreled guns such as pistols and revolvers; handheld explosives such as
                        <br><br>
                        grenades and C4 are also available. Though players can attack enemies directly,
                        <br><br>
                        they have the option to use stealth tactics to attack undetected or sneak by them;
                        <br><br>
                        the game introduces silenced weapons. While the game is linear, environments
                        <br><br>
                        feature multiple paths for players to explore; maps are larger than those in
                        <br><br>
                        Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. The game features an artificial intelligence system
                        <br><br>
                        in which hostile enemies react to any combat situation they are placed in; they
                        <br><br>
                        respond to players' actions, coordinate tactics, and cooperate with each other.
                        <br><br>
                        Players' companions are also controlled by artificial intelligence and can assist
                        <br><br>
                        in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location
                        <br><br>
                        of unseen enemies, or using weapons to attack enemies. The game features
                        <br><br>
                        periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters.
                        <br><br>
                        Players also can decide the outcome of some conversations through a dialogue
