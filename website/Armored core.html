                        The gameplay in Armored Core VI emphasizes mecha-based vehicular combat.

                        Players in this game take on the role of expert pilots in control of strong mechs
                        <br><br>
                        known as Armored Cores. The huge flexibility for modification of these mechs
                        <br><br>
                        with the use of various parts allows players to enhance and sharpen their capabilities.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        The option for players to arm their mechs with a range of weaponry is a standout
                        <br><br>aspect of the game. One on each arm and two on the mech's back are available
                        <br><br>
                        slots for these weapons. The players' broad arsenals grant users strategic freedom
                        <br><br>
                        as they participate in combat.

                        The arena concept from the game's predecessors remains in place and appears

                        to the test and compete with other players in this mode, and earn "OS Tuning"
                        <br><br>
                        chips which allow for certain abilities and upgrades to be unlocked. The in-

                        game currency, credits, is awarded to players that complete missions successfully.
                        <br><br>
                        The amount of credits earned is influenced by the objectives achieved during
