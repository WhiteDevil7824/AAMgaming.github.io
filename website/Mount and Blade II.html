                        <br><br>
                        by Prime Matter. It is a prequel to Mount & Blade: Warband, a stand-alone

                        expansion for the 2008 game Mount & Blade. Bannerlord takes place 210
                        <br><br>
                        years before its predecessor, with a setting inspired by the Migration Period.
                        <br><br>
                        Bannerlord was announced in 2012. A Steam page for the game was created
                        <br><br>
                        in late 2015; the following year, TaleWorlds began releasing weekly developer

                        diaries detailing elements of the game. An early access version of the game was

                        released on March 27, 2020 and quickly became the largest launch of the year
                        <br><br>

                        Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord is set on the fictional continent of Calradia,
                        <br><br>
                        173 years before Mount & Blade: Warband, during the decline of the
                        <br><br>
                        Calradic Empire and the formation of the predecessors of the factions that
                        <br><br>
                        appear in Warband. The downfall of the Calradic Empire is analogous to
                        <br><br>
                        the fall of the Roman Empire during the Migration Period and the
                        <br><br>
                        formation of the Middle Eastern, North African, and European realms
                        <br><br>
                        of the Early Middle Ages. The armour, clothes, weapons, and architecture
                        <br><br>
                        of each faction are inspired by their real-world counterparts from 600 to
                        <br><br>
                        1100 A.D.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord is a strategy/action role-playing game. The
                        <br><br>
                        fundamental gameplay premise is the same as previous entries in the
                        <br><br>
                        series: the player builds up a party of soldiers and performs quests on an
                        <br><br>
                        overhead campaign map, with battles being played out on battlefields
                        <br><br>
                        that allow the player to personally engage in combat alongside their troops.
                        <br><br>
                        Bannerlord, however, includes significant improvements to numerous
                        <br><br>
                        elements of gameplay.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        Sieges in Bannerlord are intended to be more strategic than they were in
                        <br><br>
                        Warband. The player may construct a variety of different siege engines
                        <br><br>
                        and strategically position them before the battle begins in order to target
                        <br><br>
                        certain sections of the enemy fortifications. On the overhead campaign
                        <br><br>
                        map, the player can choose to bombard the walls, possibly creating
                        <br><br>
                        breaches that can be used once the battle begins. To discourage
                        <br><br>
                        prolonged bombardments on the battle map, only the merlons,
                        <br><br>
                        gatehouses, and siege engines are destructible during the actual battle.
                        <br><br>
                        The design of the defending castles and cities is intended to be biased
                        <br><br>
                        in favor of the defenders; for example, murder holes are often located
                        <br><br>
                        at key chokepoints, allowing the defenders to slaughter large numbers
                        <br><br>
                        of the attackers before they can breach the gates.
                        <br><br><br><br>
                        Bannerlord, like Warband, has a multiplayer component that allows
                        <br><br>
                        players to engage in combat with each other across a variety of maps
                        <br><br>
                        and game modes. As in Warband, the multiplayer of Bannerlord is
                        <br><br>
                        restricted to battles and is separate from the campaign, although the
                        <br><br>
                        developers have expressed interest in adding multiplayer to the
                        <br><br>
                        campaign through post-release downloadable content. Bannerlord
                        <br><br>
                        utilizes a class system that allows players to choose what type of
                        <br><br>
                        soldier they want to play as. Classes are divided into three
                        <br><br>
                        categories: infantry, ranged, and cavalry. Each class has positive
                        <br><br>
                        and negative elements that are influenced by the positive and
                        <br><br>
                        negative elements of their faction in general. Players select classes
                        <br><br>
                        using a point system, which replaces the money system of Warband.
