                        There are two modes of difficulties in the Ultimate Fishing Simulator, thanks

                        <br><br>
                        included. Realistic Mode requires more patience and efficiency from the
                        <br><br>
                        player. Fish will be biting less and will fight longer. Some of the game
                        <br><br>
                        features in this mode are disabled, such as the underwater camera.
